# Arena-Stats-Tracker
A fun little personal project I built to track my League of Legends Arena progress using match data pulled from the Riot API. This Jupyter Notebook tracks how many champions I’ve played, how many I’ve placed first with, and how many matches it took me to get there.

🛡️ Arena God Tracker
