# Arena-Stats-Tracker
A fun little personal project I built to track my League of Legends Arena progress using match data pulled from the Riot API. This Jupyter Notebook tracks how many champions I‚Äôve played, how many I‚Äôve placed first with, and how many matches it took me to get there.

# üõ°Ô∏è Arena God Tracker

This Jupyter Notebook tracks my obsession with Arena mode in League of Legends. Using the Riot API, it pulls my match history and logs every champion I‚Äôve played, how many games they took to win, and how close I am to finishing my **Arena God** challenge.

## üîç What It Does

- Connects to Riot's API using my Riot ID and API key  
- Filters Arena matches based on a specific patch or event date  
- Parses and stores match details in a DataFrame  
- Calculates:
  - **Total Arena matches played**  
  - **Unique champions played**  
  - **Champions won with**  
  - **Wins on the first try**  
  - **Matches it took to get a win per champ**  
- Exports all data to Excel for easy tracking
